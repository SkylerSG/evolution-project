# Evolution Project
This is a basic (still in progression) Java project dealing with evolution through a small neural network and a semi-2D enviroment. 
This project was inspired by davidrandallmiller's evolution project here: [I programmed some creatures. They Evolved.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3tRFayqVtk).
